# nros-cypress-testing-poc
This project is a quick Proof Of Concept that tests out some functionality on the the NROS (Natural Resources Online Services) Portal using the [cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) automated testing framework.

The goal is to evaluate differences with the existing Selenium automated test implementation.
